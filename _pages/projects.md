For our 3230 fluid mechanical dissection, we dissected a fluids-based bike trainer. It provides resistance to enable stationary bike training, mimicking the physical resistance of biking outdoors. We did an in-depth analysis of the governing fluid concepts that defined the system, where my individual responsibility was the technical drawings and video editing. All members contributed to script writing as well.
